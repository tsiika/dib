# *dib*, somewhat new era of the front pages!

---



You know when the bookmark bar on your browser is not enough? And when you open a new tab you can only see a few your most visited websites? Well this project is hitting two flies with one hit and merging those earlier "problems" in one nice package!

This is only my personal view to the things.

At the moment I'm using this kind of setup. The site is running on my own server and file site is only static page where I have to hard code the links if I want new one or delete old ones.


# Idea for this project and fundamentals

The fundamental idea for this project is to have full fledged website where mostly I and maybe other users can have their own customized page up and running with their corresponding bookmark of course.

And as they open up the new tab, this page will appear to them!


# Developement

This project is running on React, Nodejs and MongoDB. 

## Bugs
24/05/2018
- When selecting the site from dashboard to show individual information about site, React doesn't parse the ID of selected site correctly. This will follow error  500 and now showing any data.
    - In backend you can see the data correctly using Insomnia for viewing for example.
- This same problem occurs also in editing site.
- Deleting the data is also affected by this.
